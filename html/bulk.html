          <h5 class="card-title">Bulking</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Bulking typically involves following a structured workout plan that emphasizes strength training and heavy lifting, combined with a high-calorie, high-protein diet that provides the nutrients and energy necessary for muscle growth. This can include eating more carbohydrates, healthy fats, and protein-rich foods such as lean meats, fish, eggs, and dairy products.

            However, it's important to note that bulking can also result in some fat gain along with muscle gain, especially if one consumes too many calories above their body's energy requirements. To minimize fat gain, it's recommended to increase calorie intake moderately, within a certain range of calories above one's maintenance level.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">Cutting</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Cutting is a period of time during which an individual reduces their calorie intake to lose body fat while retaining muscle mass. The goal of cutting is to achieve a leaner and more defined physique.

            Cutting typically involves following a structured workout plan that includes both cardiovascular exercise and resistance training, combined with a calorie-controlled diet that provides the nutrients and energy necessary to support exercise while also creating a calorie deficit. This can include reducing calorie intake, increasing protein intake, and limiting intake of high-calorie, low protein foods.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">Body Recomp</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Body recomposition typically involves following a structured workout plan that includes both resistance training and cardiovascular exercise, combined with a balanced and nutritious diet that supports muscle growth and fat loss. The diet usually involves consuming a sufficient amount of protein to support muscle growth, while also restricting calorie intake to create a modest calorie deficit.

            The process of body recomposition can be challenging, as it requires a delicate balance of calorie restriction and nutrient intake to achieve both fat loss and muscle gain. It also requires a consistent and dedicated approach to both exercise and nutrition. Keep in mind that this method typically works for individuals who have only been working out for less than a year. This
            is also typically known as the "nobbie gain" period.</p>
